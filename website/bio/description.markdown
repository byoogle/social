# Bio

I develop and market popular, highly rated products.

In the last 7 years, I’ve created 7 indie apps – for iOS, Android, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and
Opera – that’ve topped 1,000,000 active users and another 14 that’ve topped 10,000. Altogether, my
apps have been installed more than 20,000,000 times, been rated an average of more than 4.5 out of 5
stars by users, and been featured more than 1,000 times by the press and by platform vendors –
including [in
